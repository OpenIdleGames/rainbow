Lamo story
----------

King ultra has commissioned you to acquire purple numbers for the upcoming royal purple
season festival. Unfortunately all of the purple numbers in stock were destroyed
in the fiery red season festival a few months ago. You don't know anyone in the kingdom
who can make purple numbers, although you do know several traders that would be willing
to sell you a purple number in exchange for 10 blue numbers. Unfortunately you don't have
any blue numbers. But you do know several traders that would be willing to sell
you a blue number in exchange for 10 green numbers. But you don't have any green numbers either!
All you have is an enourmous stock pile of red numbers. Fortunately there seem to be plenty of traders
around. Maybe you can still work something out...

Controls
--------

To place a red number supplier in your court, first click the word
"red" at the top, and then click somewhere in the white area below. The supplier
will immediately start moving red numbers from the royal store houses into the court.
To begin purchasing orange numbers, click the word "orange" at the top, and then click a
rectangle immediately adjacent to the red supplier (above, below, to the left, or to the
right; diagonals will not work). The orange trader will display two numbers. The left
number is how many red numbers the trader has received but which have not yet been traded,
and the right number is how many orange numbers he has sold you. Trading happens very quickly,
so the left number will usually be less than ten, but sometimes traders cannot keep up with
the supply, and so they'll accumulate a backlog.

Yellow, Green, Blue, and Purple all work the same as Orange. Each color will only trade with
the next color in the header, always at an exchange of 10 to 1. 

To remove a supplier or trader from the court, click the white area to the right of the word
"purple", and then click the supplier or trader you want to remove. Be careful not to remove
someone until you have emptied both their incoming and outgoing inventories!

The king has not specified how many purple numbers are required for the festival, so you
aim to accumulate as many as you possibly can.
